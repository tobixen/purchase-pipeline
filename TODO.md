# TODO — purchase-pipeline

Tasks 0–7, all filed while processing the 2026-07-24 Sozopol shopping trip, are
done and have been removed from this file (2026-08-02); see git history for the
notes, and README.md for the design rules they settled. What is left below is
what has not been finished.

Every task assumes the project conventions in `~/.claude-personal/CLAUDE.md`:
write the failing test first, then implement; type-annotate public APIs; update
docs and CHANGELOG; commit with `git-ai-commit`; don't push without being asked.

## `osm-add-shop --commit` has never run against the live API

Every other path is tested and was rehearsed against live Overpass, but the
upload itself is unexercised. It needs two things that cannot be arranged on
demand:

* an OAuth application registered by tobixen — that registration names *them* as
  the editor, so it is not an agent's to do;
* a genuinely unmapped shop.

When the first real one turns up, rehearse against the dev server first:
`--api https://master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org`.

## `lidl-history --fetch` has never run against the live API

Lives in [order-scrapers](https://github.com/tobixen/order-scrapers), not here.
It was exercised end to end against a stub downloader; the real fetch needs a
logged-in browser session, and the browser login is deliberately not automated.
Noted here because this project is the consumer of `lidl_receipts.json`.

## Optional: derive the Billa branch key from the receipt

`match_shop_osm` now requires an exact branch key, which closed the bug. Filling
that key in automatically is still open, and is not as trivial as it looks — the
2026-07-24 Billa receipt carries two different addresses, the company's
registered address in the header (`СОЗОПОЛ УЛ. ИНДУСТРИАЛНА 3`) and the actual
store address in the card-terminal footer (`УЛ. РЕПУБЛИКАНСКА 5`). OSM matches
the footer. Which address to trust is a per-chain rule, so it belongs in
`src/purchase_pipeline/data/receipt-formats.json`.

## Not this project: best-before OCR quality

The other half of "populate `ean` + `bb` without human photo inspection".
Association is done here; extraction quality — dot-matrix print, foil, curved
surfaces, low-contrast embossing — is tracked in `~/inventory-md/docs/TODO.md`.
Nothing here can improve a date the OCR could not read.
